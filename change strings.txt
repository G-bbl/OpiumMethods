# Randomizing Cheat strings with protector & dps string changer

```
1. Download UPX protector

2. Unpack the winrar archive and open a cmd as admin, CD into the upx.exe path.

3. Drag your cheat into the same folder, and use this command to randomize strings:

upx.exe --best cheat.exe

File size will be reduced a bit and strings will change.

4. Download the "Setup.exe" (Probably ratted too!) DPS string changer.

5. After opening it drag the cheat into the command prompt it opens and dps string should be changed

```

## ⚠️ After all this you wont be able to rename the file, so make sure you do all this after you disguised the cheat
